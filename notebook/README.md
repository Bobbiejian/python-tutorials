# Python Tutorial 
This tutorial is structured so that it is easy to use, and easy to learn, and hopefully fun as well. 

## Structure
The different numbered folders are organised in a manner to mimic the progression of learning Python. Usually the earlier levels tend to pre-requisite knowlege for more in depth levels later, but can be used in whichever manner that is suitable.

Under each sub-level, each topic will have a sample and a tutorial notobook.
E.g. basic\_sample.ipynb and basic_tutorial.ipynb 

### Directory structure:
 +-- notebook <- Jupyter notebooks
 +--|-- 1_basic <- Python 101
 +--|-- 2_beginner <- Python 102
 +--|-- 3_intermdiate <- Getting serious with Python
 +--|-- 4_advanced <- Getting more out of Python
 +--|-- 5_expert <- Python Professionals
 +--|-- 6_hardcore <- Everything Python
 +--src <- Python Scripts
 +--|-- package <- a module example
