# Python Tutorials
This tutorial puts together the materials in a structured format, such that when followed, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use Python 3 for any of your needs.

Each section can be completed in order, where we assume understanding and familiarisation of previous components as prerequesites in order to move forwards.

## Section set up
Each 'section' will have jupyter notebooks that poses as tutorials for the topic as in the file name of the *.ipynb

The code snippets demonstrates the utility, and for you to execute in order to experience their output.

Once completed, there are workshops prepared.  
These workshops serves as an excercise, to practice the skills learnt from the tutorials.
See the README.md within each section for the order of the tutorials and workshops for that section.

### Workshop setup
The workshop mainly consists of the explaniation of the target of the workshop and guidelines on the steps needed to completes a workshop.

There will be Sample codes provided for the workshops as well.  
Remember that  the goal of the workshop is for you to create your own programs. The sample codes are there for reference only.
